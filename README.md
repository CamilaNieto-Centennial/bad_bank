<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>This project is a responsive webpage called "Bad Bank" because the web application respresents a bank with no security. This website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React. Please keep in mind that this is not an official website that shows up a real bank webpage. I am just a developer who wants to showcase a cool website.</p>
<p>Finally I want to inform that this website only shows the Front End part of this application. It doesn't have integrated any Database, or Back-End part.</p>
